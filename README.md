According to new GfK data, nearly 1 in 3 people do gardening or yard work daily or weekly in the world. Gardening has emerged as one of the favourite pastimes in Covid-19 scenario. But most of the people lack the accurate knowledge of how to take care of plants appropriately, thereby ending up over-watering the plants. This not only adverse the health of the plant but also leads to overflow of water. Moreover, the basic requirements of each plant differ in various forms and it gets difficult to keep in mind these requirements separately for each plant. Making a Google search for each plant is also a tedious task when it comes to big-parks and gardens. The data provided by Google is usually common world-wide but plants present at different locations undergo different weather and climatic conditions and their water-sunlight requirements vary from place to place.
We propose one stop solution for all of the problems related to taking care of the various garden plants. Our idea is to make a web-application with voice-embedded feature, Green-Care, which allows its users to store the data of their plants once and will keep track of day-to-day requirements of each plant separately, forever. Green-Care will inform its user about the day-to-day requirements of each plant depending upon the weather conditions.  Thus, it prevents the soil of the plants from getting dry or too wet thereby also contributing to water-conservation. 

Features - 

-- Green-Care will let you choose the various plants that you have or will be planting in your garden from the list of images-plants, for easy recognition. 
The details of the plants selected by the user will be displayed up-front. So the user will not need to search about the various details associated with the plants that theyâ€™re caring for.

-- The user will be notified for the times they need to water the plants, this in turn will reduce the over watering and under watering of the plant. 

-- The user will also be told about the amount of sunlight needed for the plant. 

-- Green-Care will also have a section dedicated to posting about the jobs for the people who know about gardening or are interested in taking gardening as their profession. Any user will be able to create or see a post for gardening-related job opportunities. 
The app will hence solve the problem for both kinds of people, who want to cater to their plants by themselves and also for the people who are looking for a gardener. 

-- It will also tell its user about the various uses of the plants they own.

-- Users can also sell and buy various plants under the shop section. They can create various posts for the same using voice-to-text feature.
